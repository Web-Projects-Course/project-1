# Project 1: Style-shifter

Project 1 will focus on using CSS to style a pre-existing document. Included in the project are a html document <code>raven.html</code> which contains the text of Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven" and an empty css document style.css. You should not edit the raven.html document at all. In fact when I grade your assignments I will be working with my own copy of raven.html.

###Tags

<code>raven.html</code> uses semantic html tags and class attributes to help identify different parts of the poem. Look at <code>raven.html</code> and try and determine the structure and tags used.

###Classes

Here is an explanation of some of the class elements:

* **poem** - the entire poem including the title, byline and stanzas.
* **stanza** - one stanza of the poem made up of lines.
* **line** - one line of the poem.
* **A, B, C** - The main rhyme scheme of the poem.
* **rhyme-1, rhyme-2, rhyme-3, rhyme-4** - The Raven has an internal rhyme.
* **narrator-speaks** - When the narrator speaks in the story.
* **raven-speaks** - When the Raven speaks.
* **lenore** - Any reference to Lenore
* **nevermore** - Anytime the word nevermore is used.
