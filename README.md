# Project 1: Style-shifter

Project 1 will focus on using CSS to style a pre-existing document. Included in the project are a html document <code>raven.html</code> which contains the text of Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven" and an empty css document style.css. 

For you assignment you goal is to create an illustration, reinterpretation or complete re-writing of this famous poem. One approach might be expand on the imagery of the poem itelf. Another might be to use the technique of redaction poets to create your own poem from Poe's work. A third might be to simply use the poem as raw material for a complete new work of art. While not strickly interactive, think about ways of using the web pages features (mousing over, scrolling, etc.) to your advantage. What new ways might you find to read the work.

You should not edit the raven.html document at all. In fact when I grade your assignments I will be working with my own copy of raven.html. It often the case that as a web designer, you mostly have access only to the CSS and not the HTML of a web projects. Being able to work with existing HTML is an important skill and should allow you to explore the full possibilities of CSS.
