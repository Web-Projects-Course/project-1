# Project 1: Style-shifter

Project 1 will focus on using CSS to style a pre-existing document. Included in the project are a html document "raven.html" which contains the text of Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven" and an empty css document "style.css". You should not edit the raven.html document at all. In fact when I grade your assignments I will be working with my own copy of raven.html.
