      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Once upon a midnight <span class="rhyme-1">dreary</span>, while I pondered, weak and <span class="rhyme-1">weary</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,</p>
        <p class="line C">While I nodded, nearly <span class="rhyme-2">napping</span>, suddenly there came a <span class="rhyme-2">tapping</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">As of some one gently <span class="rhyme-2">rapping</span>, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">“ ’Tis some visiter,”</span> I muttered, <span class="narrator-speaks">“tapping at my chamber door —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Only this, and nothing more.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Ah, distinctly I <span class="rhyme-1">remember</span> it was in the bleak <span class="rhyme-1">December</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
        <p class="line C">Eagerly I wished the <span class="rhyme-2">morrow</span>; — vainly I had tried to <span class="rhyme-2">borrow</span></p>
        <p class="line B">From my books surcease of <span class="rhyme-2">sorrow</span> — sorrow for the lost <span class="lenore">Lenore</span> —</p>
        <p class="line B">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <span class="lenore">Lenore</span> —</p>
        <p class="line B">Nameless here for evermore.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">And the silken sad <span class="rhyme-1">uncertain</span> rustling of each purple <span class="rhyme-1">curtain</span></p>
        <p class="line B">Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
        <p class="line C">So that now, to still the <span class="rhyme-2">beating</span> of my heart, I stood <span class="rhyme-2">repeating</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">“ ’Tis some visiter <span class="rhyme-2">entreating</span> entrance at my chamber door —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">This it is, and nothing more.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Presently my soul grew <span class="rhyme-1">stronger</span>; hesitating then no <span class="rhyme-1">longer</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Sir,”</span> said I, <span class="narrator-speaks">“or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</span></p>
        <p class="line C"><span class="narrator-speaks">But the fact is I was <span class="rhyme-2">napping</span>, and so gently you came <span class="rhyme-2">rapping</span></span>,</p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">And so faintly you came <span class="rhyme-2">tapping</span>, tapping at my chamber door,</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">That I scarce was sure I heard you”</span> — here I opened wide the door; —</p>
        <p class="line B">Darkness there, and nothing more.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Deep into that darkness <span class="rhyme-1">peering</span>, long I stood there wondering, <span class="rhyme-1">fearing</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
        <p class="line C">But the silence was <span class="rhyme-2">unbroken</span>, and the darkness gave no <span class="rhyme-2">token</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">And the only word there <span class="rhyme-2">spoken</span> was the whispered word, “<span class="lenore">Lenore!</span>”</p>
        <p class="line B">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “<span class="lenore">Lenore!</span>”</p>
        <p class="line B">Merely this, and nothing more.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Then into the chamber <span class="rhyme-1">turning</span>, all my soul within me <span class="rhyme-1">burning</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.</p>
        <p class="line C"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Surely,”</span> said I, <span class="narrator-speaks">“surely that <span class="rhyme-2">is</span> something at my window <span class="rhyme-2">lattice</span>;</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Let me see, then, what thereat <span class="rhyme-2">is</span>, and this mystery explore —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">’Tis the wind, and nothing more!”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Open here I flung the <span class="rhyme-1">shutter</span>, when, with many a flirt and <span class="rhyme-1">flutter</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">In there stepped a stately <span class="raven">raven</span> of the saintly days of yore;</p>
        <p class="line C">Not the least obeisance made <span class="rhyme-2">he</span>; not an instant stopped or stayed <span class="rhyme-2">he</span>;</p>
        <p class="line B">But, with mien of lord or <span class="rhyme-2">lady</span>, perched above my chamber door —</p>
        <p class="line B">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door —</p>
        <p class="line B">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Then this ebony bird <span class="rhyme-1">beguiling</span> my sad fancy into <span class="rhyme-1">smiling</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,</p>
        <p class="line C"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Though thy crest be shorn and <span class="rhyme-2">shaven</span>, thou,”</span> I said, <span class="narrator-speaks">“art sure no <span class="rhyme-2">craven</span>,</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Ghastly grim and ancient <span class="raven rhyme-2">raven</span> wandering from the Nightly shore —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”</span></p>
        <p class="line B">Quoth the <span class="raven">raven</span>, <span class="nevermore raven-speaks">“Nevermore.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Much I marvelled this <span class="rhyme-1">ungainly</span> fowl to hear discourse so <span class="rhyme-1">plainly</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">Though its answer little meaning — little relevancy bore;</p>
        <p class="line C">For we cannot help <span class="rhyme-2">agreeing</span> that no sublunary <span class="rhyme-2">being</span></p>
        <p class="line B">Ever yet was blessed with <span class="rhyme-2">seeing</span> bird above his chamber door —</p>
        <p class="line B">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</p>
        <p class="line B">With such name as <span class="nevermore">“Nevermore.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">But the <span class="raven">raven</span>, sitting <span class="rhyme-1">lonely</span> on the placid bust, spoke <span class="rhyme-1">only</span></p>
        <p class="line B">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</p>
        <p class="line C">Nothing farther then he <span class="rhyme-2">uttered</span> — not a feather then he <span class="rhyme-2">fluttered</span> —</p>
        <p class="line B">Till I scarcely more than <span class="rhyme-2">muttered</span>, <span class="narrator-speaks">“Other friends have flown before —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”</span></p>
        <p class="line B">Quoth the <span class="raven">raven</span>, <span class="nevermore raven-speaks">“Nevermore.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Wondering at the stillness <span class="rhyme-1">broken</span> by reply so aptly <span class="rhyme-1">spoken</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Doubtless,”</span> said I, <span class="narrator-speaks">“what it utters is its only stock and store,</span></p>
        <p class="line C"><span class="narrator-speaks">Caught from some unhappy <span class="rhyme-2">master</span> whom unmerciful <span class="rhyme-2">Disaster</span></span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Followed fast and followed <span class="rhyme-2">faster</span></span> — so, when Hope he would adjure,</p>
        <p class="line B">Stern Despair returned, instead of the sweet Hope he dared adjure —</p>
        <p class="line B">That sad answer, <span class="nevermore raven-speaks">“Nevermore!”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">But the <span class="raven">raven</span> still <span class="rhyme-1">beguiling</span> all my sad soul into <span class="rhyme-1">smiling</span>,</p>
        <p class="line B">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust, and door;</p>
        <p class="line C">Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</p>
        <p class="line B">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore —</p>
        <p class="line B">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</p>
        <p class="line B">Meant in croaking <span class="nevermore">“Nevermore.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">This I sat engaged in <span class="rhyme-1">guessing</span>, but no syllable <span class="rhyme-1">expressing</span></p>
        <p class="line B">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;</p>
        <p class="line C">This and more I sat <span class="rhyme-2">divining</span>, with my head at ease <span class="rhyme-2">reclining</span></p>
        <p class="line B">On the cushion’s velvet <span class="rhyme-2">lining</span> that the lamplight [[lamp-light]] gloated o’er,</p>
        <p class="line B">But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight [[lamp-light]] gloating o’er,</p>
        <p class="line B">She shall press, ah, <span class="nevermore">nevermore!</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A">Then, methought, the air grew <span class="rhyme-1">denser</span>, perfumed from an unseen <span class="rhyme-1">censer</span></p>
        <p class="line B">Swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</p>
        <p class="line C"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Wretch,”</span> I cried, <span class="narrator-speaks">“thy God hath lent thee — by these angels he hath sent thee</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Respite — respite and Nepenthe from thy memories of <span class="lenore">Lenore!</span></span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Let me quaff this kind Nepenthe and forget this lost <span class="lenore">Lenore!</span>”</span></p>
        <p class="line B">Quoth the <span class="raven">raven</span>, <span class="nevermore raven-speaks">“Nevermore.”</span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line A"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Prophet!”</span> said I, <span class="narrator-speaks">“thing of <span class="rhyme-1">evil</span>! — prophet still, if bird or <span class="rhyme-1">devil</span>! —</span></p>
        <p class="line B"><span class="narrator-speaks">Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</span></p>
        <p class="line C"><span class="narrator-speaks">Desolate, yet all <span class="rhyme-2">undaunted</span>, on this desert land <span class="rhyme-2">enchanted</span> —</span></p>

        <p class="line A"><span class="narrator-speaks">“Be that word our sign of <span class="rhyme-1">parting</span>, bird or fiend!”</span> I shrieked, <span class="rhyme-1">upstarting</span> —</p>
